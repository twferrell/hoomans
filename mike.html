    <div class="content">
        <h2>About the Man, the Myth, the Legend</h2>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> California (the sunny Gotham of the West Coast)</p>
        <p>When he's not slinging RVs faster than Batman throws a batarang, Mike Herron is busy being a father to three dynamic daughters: Kasie, Ashley, and Erica. With his quick wit, legendary dad jokes, and secret stash of Batman memorabilia, Mike proves every day that he's the hero his family deserves... and possibly the one they need.</p>

        <h2>Family Allies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rhonda (aka "The Mastermind"): </strong> Former manager of a Mexican restaurant, known for legendary enchiladas and always keeping things in line.</li>
            <li><strong>Kasie (Eldest Daughter):</strong> Married to Thomas, Mike's favorite son-in-law, with two kids, Christian and Halee. Currently residing in the rustic hideout of Mead, Oklahoma.</li>
            <li><strong>Ashley (The Middle One):</strong> Has two little sidekicks, Darrien and Mariah, and always ready to offer her dad some grandkid-level distractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Erica (The Youngest):</strong> Living in Texas with her husband Julio, the mighty plumber, and their kids, Aubrey, Cameron, and Brice. Keeps Rhonda close for backup assistance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Legendary Moments</h2>
        <p>In a daring escape attempt from Kasie's rural lair in Oklahoma, Mike and Rhonda found themselves in a true caper. Rhonda, realizing she had left her pillow behind, hopped out of their getaway truck with the passenger door wide open. Mike, always resourceful, decided to reverse the truck instead of turning it around... right into a tree. Thankfully, Thomas stepped up as the ultimate sidekick, doing a quick fix to make sure they could ride off into the sunset (or at least, down the driveway).</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Perfect Attendance</strong>: Mike never missed a day of school - a fact he wears with more pride than his Crest White Strips smile.</li>
            <li><strong>Collector Extraordinaire</strong>: Mike's got a Batman collection that could rival Bruce Wayne's hidden stash.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunglasses Inside?</strong>: Yep. Mike's cool level is often measured in shades - literally.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Leaning:</strong> Mike plans to vote for Trump, as he leans Republican.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rhonda: The Real Hero</h2>
        <p>Whether it's remembering every family birthday or organizing legendary enchilada feasts, Rhonda keeps the family together like Alfred keeps the Batcave in order. She's now stationed in Texas, busy taking care of grandkids and keeping her eye on the prize - family unity and happiness.</p>
